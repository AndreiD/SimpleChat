## :star: Installation Guide:

### Step 1
You should get familiar with Firebase (at least a little) before.
https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup

### Step 2
Because you'll want to modify this to something custom (colors, logic, your auth system etc) there's no point in making a gradle library for this. 

Create a new firebase project https://firebase.google.com/console/ and keep your google-service.json file somewhere safe.


Clone, fork or download a zip and check the files. 
There's no magic inside and I've tried to keep everything as simple as possible.
Star this repository :)

### Step 3 (Optional) 
:cop: You might want to implement your auth system, using firebase or your own.

### Step 4 
???

### Step 5
Profit
