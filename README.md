### Installation Guide:

#### Step 1

You should get familiar with Firebase (at least a little) before.
https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup

#### Step 2

Because you'll want to modify this to something custom (colors, logic, your auth system etc) there's no point in making a gradle library for this. 

Create a new firebase project https://firebase.google.com/console/ and keep your google-service.json file somewhere safe.


Clone, fork or download a zip, check the files. It's just a big main file with everything inside :), an adaptor, and few utilities.
