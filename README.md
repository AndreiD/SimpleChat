Simple Chat
===========

### This is a simple, realtime, copy-paste, chat system for Android:

Using firebase!

### How to use it:

#### Step 1

You should get familiar with Firebase (at least a little) before.

#### Step 2

Create a new firebase project and keep your google-service.json file somewhere safe.
Clone, fork or download a zip, check the files. It's just a big main file with everything inside :), an adaptor, and few utilities.
